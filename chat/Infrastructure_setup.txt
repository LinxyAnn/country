Hi, I am Java developer. Please pretend experienced Java developer and explain step-by-step, what I should do to create new Java Spring Boot project using Intellij idea.
Please provide all  detail about setting to this project. Also provide what dependencies should be included to this project. Purpose of project: creating endpoint with parameters, which can get data from another public API, parse response in Java Object. This project should include Unit Test and bind SonarCloud.io. We can not use any 3rd party libraries, only core Java functionality .
After creating this project I should share this project to GitHub. First commit (which include ReadMe.md should have name “UC#1 Start” (not "initial commit")

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a Java Spring Boot project using IntelliJ IDEA for your specific purpose:

Step 1: Setting up the Project
Open IntelliJ IDEA:
If you don't have IntelliJ IDEA, you should download and install the Ultimate Edition, because Spring Initializr and other Spring-related features are not present in the Community Edition.

Create a New Project:

Select File > New > Project.
Choose Spring Initializr from the left pane.
Make sure the SDK is set to the correct Java version (e.g., Java 11 or newer).
Click Next.
Project Metadata:

Group: Typically your organization or personal domain.
Artifact: The name of your project.
Click Next.
Select Dependencies:
For your described project, select the following:

Spring Web (for creating web applications).
Spring Boot DevTools (for automatic restarts and live reload during development).
Since you're going to be writing tests, the Spring Boot Starter Test dependency will be automatically added.
Click Next and then Finish.
Step 2: Create an Endpoint
In the main application package, create a new package named controller.

Inside controller, create a new class named ApiController.

Add the following to ApiController:

java
Copy code
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ApiController {

    @GetMapping("/fetch")
    public ResponseEntity<String> fetchDataFromExternalApi(@RequestParam String param) {
        // Here you will make a connection to the external API, fetch data, and return.
        // Since you cannot use 3rd party libraries, you'll rely on HttpURLConnection.
        String response = ""; // Your actual logic will replace this placeholder.
        return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
    }
}
Step 3: Connect to External API
In the above method (fetchDataFromExternalApi), you'd typically use a library like RestTemplate. However, since 3rd party libraries are restricted, use HttpURLConnection from Java's standard library.

Step 4: Write Tests
Navigate to src/test/java in your project structure.

Create a test class for ApiController, for example, ApiControllerTest.

Write tests using the Spring Boot testing framework. This will use JUnit and Mockito which are already added as dependencies.

Step 5: Bind SonarCloud
Create an account on SonarCloud.io.
Setup your project on SonarCloud.
In IntelliJ, install the SonarLint plugin.
Link the plugin to your SonarCloud account and bind it to your project.
Step 6: Share the Project to GitHub
Initialize a Git repository in your project:

bash
Copy code
git init
Create a .gitignore file for Java and Spring Boot related files. IntelliJ might already generate one for you.

Commit your initial changes:

bash
Copy code
echo "# Your_Project_Name" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "UC#1 Start"
Go to GitHub and create a new repository.

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository and push your initial changes:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin [Your_GitHub_Repo_URL]
git push -u origin master
Now, your Spring Boot project is set up and pushed to GitHub, and you can proceed to develop further features, endpoints, and integrations as required.

How make GitHub repository public?
ChatGPT
To make a GitHub repository public, you need to have administrative rights to that repository. Here's how you can change a private repository to public on GitHub:

Go to Your Repository:

Open a web browser and navigate to GitHub.
Log in if you're not already logged in.
Go to your private repository.
Open Repository Settings:

Click on the Settings tab. This is located towards the right of the screen below the repository name.
Change Repository Visibility:

Scroll down to the "Danger Zone" section at the bottom of the settings page.
Click on Change repository visibility.
You'll be prompted to confirm the action. Since making a repository public will expose all of its content, including its history, issues, and pull requests, be certain this is what you want.
Select Public, enter the repository name for confirmation, and then click on the button to make the repository public.
Confirmation:

Once you've done this, your repository should now be public. You can verify by logging out or browsing in incognito and trying to access the repository URL. If it's accessible, then it's public.
Remember, once a repository is public, anyone can see it, so ensure that no sensitive data, keys, or confidential information are present in the repository or its history.

You write me how bind sonarcloud to intellij idea. Now I need bind SonarCloud.io to repository, which was created
ChatGPT
Certainly! Binding your GitHub repository to SonarCloud.io involves a series of steps to integrate both platforms. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Sign Up/Log in to SonarCloud:
If you don’t have an account on SonarCloud.io, create one. You can use your GitHub account to sign up directly.
2. Add a New Project:
After logging in to SonarCloud, click on the + (plus) icon in the top right corner and select Analyze New Project.

SonarCloud will prompt you to choose an organization for your new project. If you logged in using your GitHub account, your GitHub organizations (and personal account as an organization) will be listed here. Choose the appropriate organization that owns the repository.

After selecting an organization, SonarCloud will display a list of repositories from your GitHub account or from the organization you've chosen. Select the repository you want to analyze.

3. Set Up Analysis:
After choosing a repository, SonarCloud will guide you through setting up the analysis. Depending on your project language and build tool, the instructions might differ.

For a Java project using Maven, for example, SonarCloud will provide you with a mvn command to run in your local environment. This command will include your project's specific SonarCloud token.
Run the provided command in your project's root directory.

4. GitHub Actions or Other CI Tools:
If you want continuous scanning of your code whenever you push to GitHub, consider setting up GitHub Actions with SonarCloud.

SonarCloud provides a template for the GitHub Actions workflow when you set up the project. You can use this template to create a .yml file inside .github/workflows in your repository to automate the SonarCloud analysis with each push or pull request.

5. Reviewing Analysis:
After you've run the analysis command on your project, go back to SonarCloud.io. In a short while, you should see the analysis results for your project.

With the GitHub Actions integration, every time you push code or create a pull request, your code will be analyzed, and the results will be displayed on SonarCloud.io.

6. Protecting Your Branches (Optional):
You can set up your GitHub repository to prevent merges of pull requests that don’t pass the quality gate set on SonarCloud.

To do this, go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules. Create or edit a rule and under Status checks, you should find checks related to SonarCloud. Enable them to make passing the SonarCloud quality gate mandatory for pull request merges.

Now your GitHub repository is connected with SonarCloud.io, enabling you to maintain code quality and reliability through continuous code analysis.

Thank you. Now I can analyze me project in https://sonarcloud.io/
Could you please tell me, how I can see Sonar result in GitHub site?
ChatGPT
Certainly! To see SonarCloud results directly in GitHub (on pull requests or pushes), you'll need to set up SonarCloud checks for your repository. Here's how:

1. PR Decoration and GitHub Checks:
Once SonarCloud is properly integrated with your GitHub repository, it will automatically "decorate" pull requests with its analysis results. This is commonly referred to as "PR decoration".

When a new pull request is created or when new commits are added to an existing pull request, SonarCloud will analyze the changes and display the results directly within the pull request in the form of GitHub checks.

2. Setting Up Checks:
Go to your GitHub repository.
Navigate to the Settings tab.
In the left sidebar, click on Branches.
Under "Branch protection rules", click on Add rule or edit an existing rule.
In the "Protect matching branches" section, you can specify which branches this rule should apply to. For instance, you can use main or * to select all branches.
Scroll down to the "Status checks found in the last week for this repository" section.
You should see checks related to SonarCloud (e.g., SonarCloud Code Analysis). Check them to enforce their status for pull request merges.
Configure any other protection settings as needed and then click Save changes.
3. PR Decoration in Action:
Once the above setup is done:

When you create a new pull request or push new changes to an existing one, SonarCloud will analyze the code.

After the analysis, in the pull request, you'll see the status checks. Click on Details next to the SonarCloud check to view more detailed analysis results.

The PR decoration will highlight issues directly in your pull request's "Files changed" tab. This makes it easier to address code quality and security concerns before merging changes.

Remember, for this to work seamlessly, you should have a CI process (like GitHub Actions) set up to trigger SonarCloud analysis on code pushes or pull request events. This ensures that SonarCloud always has fresh data to display on GitHub.
